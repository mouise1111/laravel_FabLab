## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with relationships which includes users, articles, comments, tags, favorites and follows. This can help you to quickly start testing the api or couple a frontend and start using it with ready content.**

Open the DatabaseSeeder and set the property values as per your requirement

    database/seeds/DatabaseSeeder.php

Run the database seeder and you're done
